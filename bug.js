This error occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API and attempting to access the camera's features before it has fully initialized.  This often happens when the camera component is rendered before the necessary permissions are granted or the camera itself is ready. It can manifest as a silent failure, where the camera preview doesn't appear or functions don't work, or it might throw an explicit error related to the camera being unavailable or undefined. This is particularly common when working with asynchronous operations involving the camera.
